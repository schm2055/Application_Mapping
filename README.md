# Application_Mapping
Mapping applications to their relevant services

This script is used to map applications running in an environment to relevant services. Additionally, instances of the services are then reated to
their corresponding applications as well. This information is used in other applications to draw meaningful dependencies between applications and
devices.

This is still being developed... more to come.
